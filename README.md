# BinaryClock
This is a clock that displays H:M:S in binary, written in C++ using the SFML library

The program uses the font DS-DIGITAL by Dusit Supasawat, you can get it here https://www.dafont.com/ds-digital.font. I don't know if I can just include it in 
the github repository.

This program can change between 3 different color schemes by the user pressing the C key
