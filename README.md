# BinaryClock
This is a clock that displays H:MM:SS in binary, written in C++ using the SFML library

The program uses the font DS-DIGITAL by Dusit Supasawat, you can get it here https://www.dafont.com/ds-digital.font. Just get the DS-DIGIB.ttf and put it with the .exe
and maybe throw some money that guy's way.

If you wish to build it just put the include folder from a download of SFML in the project directory like .\SFML\include

This program can change between 3 different color schemes by the user pressing the C key
